## Voice Recorder and Player

This is a small demonstration of using the built-in mic to record audio, and using the native HTML `audio` tag to play it back. It relies on the external package [mic-recorder-to-mp3](https://github.com/closeio/mic-recorder-to-mp3) for the initial recording logic.

#### Starting

```
$ npm i
$ npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
